!!The code works, but the program is not 100% complete with all functionalities!!
!!BUGS might occur!!

The server needs the following additional libraries:
- flask
- sqlalchemy

- GPUtil

To use the client on linux change the "hashcat.exe" to "hashcat" in line 97 and v
To use the client on windows change the server ip in line 15 and add the file in your hashcat foulder
