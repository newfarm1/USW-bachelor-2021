# USW-bachelor-2021
This is the code i wrote for my bachelor in computer forensic.
!!The code works, but the program is not 100% complete with all functionalities!!
!!BUGS might occur!!

The server needs the following additional libraries:
- flask
- sqlalchemy

The client needs the following additional libraries:
- GPUtil

To use the client on linux change the "hashcat.exe" to "hashcat" in line 97
